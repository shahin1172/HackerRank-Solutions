Problem: Word Order (HackerRank Challenge)

Task:
- You are given 'N' words. Some words may repeat. 
- For each unique word, print the total number of distinct words.
- Then print how many times each unique word appears in the order they were input.

Input:
    4
    apple
    orange
    apple
    banana

Output:
    3       # Number of distinct words (apple, orange, banana)
    2 1 1   # Occurrences of each word

Concepts Used:
- Python `collections.Counter` to count occurrences of words.
- List operations, loops, and input/output handling.


"""

from collections import Counter
N=int(input())
li=[]
for i in range(N):
    b=input()
    li.append(b)
a=Counter(li)
print(len((a)))
print(*a.values())
