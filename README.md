# HackerRank Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my **HackerRank Solutions** repository! This repo contains Python solutions to a variety of coding challenges from HackerRank, showcasing my problem-solving skills and programming expertise.

I created this repository to:
- Practice algorithms and data structures.
- Sharpen my Python coding skills.
- Build a portfolio of solved problems for future reference.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**:
  - `collections` (e.g., Counter, defaultdict)
  - `math` (e.g., factorial, gcd)
  - `itertools` (e.g., permutations, combinations)
  - `functools` (e.g., lru_cache for memoization)
  - `re` (Regular Expressions for string processing)
  - `datetime` (working with dates and times)
  - `sys` (command-line argument handling)
- **Concepts Covered**:
  - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)
  - Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
  - Problem Solving (Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms)
  - Recursion and Memoization
## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add more solutions for algorithm and data structure problems from HackerRank.
- Organize solutions into folders based on topics (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Graphs).
- Document each solution with detailed problem descriptions and code explanations.
- Add unit tests to validate the solutions.
